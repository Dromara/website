As compared with the <code>TCC</code> mode, the user doesn't have to concern about how to write the rollback method at all.\nand then it can reduces user development volume and is entirely transparent to users.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>TAC</code> Mode is only suitable for Relational Database.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>TAC</code> Mode will intercept the user's SQL statement to generate reverse rollback SQL, and the compatibility of SQL will also be a ordeal.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
